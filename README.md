# Small Python Projects #

This repository is comprised of many different small Python projects that complete a specific task. They are collected either from [code challenges](https://www.codewars.com/users/Wintro) or the [Mega Project List](https://github.com/karan/Projects), otherwise they are from my own creation.

Each project will have it's own detailed description inside its respective folder.

## Overview ##
Most small projects are stored in
https://www.codewars.com/users/Wintro


## Goals ##
The goal of this repository is to teach myself how to manage projects effectively, as well as learning the different aspects of building and testing in Python. In addition, it practically introduces important parts of production code such as automating testing suites, code modularity, as well as code efficiency and optimization.

In general, the programs displayed here will not have any practical application, however the concepts underlying them serve to empower my abilities as a developer.


## Guidelines ##
  * Every project will contain the source code of the project in whole.
  * Every project will contain tests and any additional required libraries.
  * Every project is a completely separate and independent program, they may not cross-link.
  * Every project should contain a relevant and complete testing suite as well as automated building and testing configuration files.
  * Every project should have a detailed `README.md` file explaining all of the program.
